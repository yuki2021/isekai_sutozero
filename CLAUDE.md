## Development Notes

This is a creative writing project with no traditional build/test commands. The main workflow involves:
1. Referencing planning materials
2. Writing chapters in markdown format
3. Maintaining character consistency and plot coherence
4. Ensuring appropriate chapter length (8,000-15,000 characters per chapter target)
